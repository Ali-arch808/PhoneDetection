# PhoneDetection
This is for my BSc dissertation. For a summary of the project, refere to dissertation_concise.pdf(unofficial). For the official, persian one, contact me.

Use collect_ear_dataset.py to create images from the sides of the head.
Use Transfer Learning.ipynb to create the model with EfficientNet backbone.

Use the Implementation.py to run the trained model on the camera feed from the face front.

*****************************************************************
The input dataset created was 4500 negative and 3500 positive images since the model had some bias towards positive samples.
The accuracy attained was 87%.
